The team managed to join the RoboMaster North America University League competition, being the only european team to compete. Our team was the only one using two-wheeled balancing robots, bringing the technological challenge to a new level for the following years. MECHANICAL GROUP In season 2022, our mechanical team managed to design and build two two-wheeled balancing robots. The major features of the balancing robot are its lower weight and smaller dimensions compared to a four-wheeled standard robot. This implies a lower power consumption as well as better performance for what concerns the mobility, maximum speed and acceleration. Carbon Fiber and Aluminum has been chosen to be the main structure materials, this allowed to reduce the overall weight, which resulted to be 9.5 Kg. In 2023 our mechanical group will further enhance the performance of the robots, with a focus on compensating the unavoidable variations of the center of mass. In 2023, we will also update our balancing robots to a leg-wheels structure that will be significantly helpful for control and mobility. ELECTRICAL & CONTROL GROUP Our Electrical & Control Group worked hard to build a complete framework based on FreeRTOS to acquire and transmit data from the different components of three different types of robots using STM32F4 boards. Starting our tests on a four-wheeled standard robot, we accepted the technological challenge of building and controlling a two-wheeled balancing robot. A preliminary mathematical analysis has been conducted on the robots, in order to understand their kinematic/dynamic behaviour and write equations that describe the motion of each of their main parts. Then, state-of-the-art control techniques were used to design algorithms to control them and make them behave as desired, implementing ad-hoc heuristics to optimize the performance of our two-wheeled balancing robots and making them robust to external disturbances. All main functionalities of the robots were implemented successfully, guaranteeing us to be competitive against other teams taking part to the competition. Despite the four-wheeled standard robot seemed to behave as desired in most real contexts, there are a lot of improvements that still need to be implemented in the control of the two-wheeled balancing robots, whose complex non-linear behaviours makes it hard to make them behave nicely in all on-the-ground contexts, like when going up a ramp and unstucking from obstacles. Solving those problems and improving the overall performance of the robots, evaluating also the implementation on ROS, will be the main goal for next year's Electrical & Control group. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GROUP In 2022 our Artificial Intelligence Group managed to implement computer vision algorithms able to detect desired targets, taking care of the entire process of image acquisition, target detection and coordinates transmission. We managed to achieve hardware/software compatibility using docker and we were able to interact with ZED 2 camera using it for our purpose. In 2023 the Artificial Intelligence group main goal is to prepare for the RoboMaster AI Challenge, implementing SLAM features on the robot in order to let them compete without any pilot. Furthermore, wewe will improve our pipeline performance and we will implement the target position prediction. One more important step is the implementation of more ROS2 modules.\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 9,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }, this)\n  }, void 0, false, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 8,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }, this);\n}\n_c = About;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"About\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","About"],"sources":["/home/italianconcerto/Projects/roboto_website/client/src/components/About.js"],"sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\"\n\n\nexport default function About(){\n\n    \n    return (\n        <div className=\"about\">\n            <p className=\"mainSection\">\n            In 2022 Team RoboTO worked hard for RoboMaster season 2022 and robotics research in the field of Mechanical, Electrical and Control Engineering as well as in Artificial Intelligence.
